The Trash Counter is a smart trash bin designed to track bottle deposits using RFID technology. Each time a bottle is dropped in, the bin records the transaction and updates the user's points in a database for reward redemption. The bin features an LCD display for real-time information and automatically opens and closes during the deposit process. It also locks when full to prevent overflow.
